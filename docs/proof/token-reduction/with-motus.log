This log is generated directly from coordination.db events.

## Receipt 1: ADHOC-WR-001

Lease: lease-20260107-92a943de
Agent: model-agent
Issued: 2026-01-07T00:20:20Z
Status: released (success)
Resources:
- file:src/workflow_runner.py

Outcomes:
- file: src/workflow_runner.py (Workflow runner models and in-memory store)

Decisions:
- Use dataclasses and enums for workflows and run states | rationale: Keeps the data model explicit and easy to serialize | alternatives: Pydantic models

Evidence:
- log | log: Scaffolded workflow runner models and in-memory store.

## Receipt 2: ADHOC-WR-002

Lease: lease-20260107-03906160
Agent: api-agent
Issued: 2026-01-07T00:20:21Z
Status: released (success)
Resources:
- file:src/api.py

Outcomes:
- file: src/api.py (API helpers for workflows, runs, and logs)

Decisions:
- Require X-API-Key and keep the store module-level | rationale: Keeps the demo focused and avoids complex dependency injection | alternatives: Pass store instance per call

Evidence:
- diff | diff: Added API helpers: create_workflow, list_workflows, start_run, list_run_logs.

## Receipt 3: ADHOC-WR-003

Lease: lease-20260107-01738e5d
Agent: test-agent

Status: released (success)
Resources:
- file:src/test_workflows.py

Outcomes:
- file: src/test_workflows.py (Integration tests for workflow runner demo)

Decisions:
- Keep tests lightweight and run in-memory | rationale: Matches the demo scope while proving behavior | alternatives: Spin up external services

Evidence:
- test_result | tests: passed=2, failed=0, skipped=0 | log: 2 passed in 0.02s
