# Token Reduction Demo Methodology

This demo compares a manual handoff versus Motus receipts for a realistic
3-step workflow runner build (model, API, tests).

## Scenario

- A developer implements a workflow runner with:
  - Data model + in-memory store
  - API wrapper functions
  - Integration tests
- The canonical spec lives under:
  - packages/website/benchmark/demo/docs/
  - packages/website/benchmark/demo/templates/

## Manual log

The manual log is a single paste of:
- The spec, API contract, schema, decisions, acceptance tests, and roadmap
- Full source code for the three files

Generated by:
- packages/website/benchmark/render_manual_log.py

## Motus log

The Motus log is rendered from coordination.db events for three receipts:
- ADHOC-WR-001 (model)
- ADHOC-WR-002 (API)
- ADHOC-WR-003 (tests)

Generated by:
- packages/website/benchmark/render_receipts.py

## Token measurement

- Tokenizer: tiktoken when available
- Encoding: cl100k_base
- If tiktoken is unavailable, results.json records char_count instead

## Reproduce

Run:

```bash
bash packages/website/benchmark/run.sh
```
