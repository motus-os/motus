# Asset Registry (Future)

Status: Future
Roadmap: RI-IP-001

## Purpose

The Asset Registry tracks IP assets, ownership, license terms, and usage rules.
It defines how work can be licensed and how attribution is recorded.

## Boundaries

- Asset IDs are stable and namespace-scoped.
- License terms are machine-readable.
- Usage attribution references Work Ledger entries.
- Access policies are enforced by proof gates.

## Integration Notes

- Depends on the Work Ledger for provenance.
- Feeds the Motus Exchange for brokerage flows.
