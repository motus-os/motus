# Motus Blueprints (Chartering + Scaffolding)

Status: building
Roadmap: RI-MOD-070

## Purpose
Provide deterministic scaffolds for programs, projects, and workstreams.

## Implementation Notes
- Scaffolds are deterministic and repeatable.
- Templates never hide required evidence.
- Optional register writes go through Work Compiler.

## Best Practices
- Keep templates small and composable.
- Ensure generated files follow FILE-POLICY.
- Provide clear upgrade paths for template versions.
