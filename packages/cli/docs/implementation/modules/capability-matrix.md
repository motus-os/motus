# Capability Matrix (Skills + Capabilities Registry)

Status: building
Roadmap: RI-MOD-010

## Purpose
Provide a stable capability registry and grants so eligibility decisions are
explainable and auditable.

## Implementation Notes
- Capability IDs are kernel-owned and stable.
- Skill-to-capability mapping stays in userland config.
- Grants must be deterministic and explainable.

## Best Practices
- Version capability schemas.
- Record eligibility decisions with rationale.
- Avoid free-form capability strings.
