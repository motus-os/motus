# Motus Exchange (Future)

Status: Future
Roadmap: RI-IP-005

## Purpose

Motus Exchange is the brokerage layer for licensing IP assets and routing
verified work execution. It coordinates terms, evidence, and settlement.

## Boundaries

- Transactions reference asset and ledger entries.
- Pricing and usage terms are explicit and auditable.
- Execution proofs are required for settlement.
- Exchange writes must not bypass policy gates.

## Integration Notes

- Depends on Asset Registry and Work Ledger.
- Uses proof artifacts as settlement evidence.
