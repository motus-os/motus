# ADR-2025-12-18: Phase 0.1.4 Enforcement Defaults OFF

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-12-18

## Context
Phase 0.1.4 established and benchmarked the Motus enforcement kernel, including:
- Evidence + verification
- Scope reconciliation (D ⊆ R)
- WORK-COMPLETE binding (evidence bound to immutable source state)
- Adversarial detection / fail-closed invariants

The Phase 0.1.4 agent-execution benchmark results showed:
- Protocols **prevent damage** (safety invariants hold).
- Protocols **did not improve** effectiveness (ΔResolved@1 not proven) under measured conditions.

This is a falsifiable outcome: the kernel can be correct (prevention-proven) without yet providing measurable lift on “better work”.

Primary evidence (vault repo):
- `core/governance/benchmarks/phase-0.1.4/REPORT-scored.md`
- `core/governance/benchmarks/phase-0.1.4/DECISION.md`

## Decision
Enforcement defaults are **OFF**.

Enforcement remains available as **opt-in** until effectiveness lift is proven.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Avoids paying cycle-time and friction costs by default when lift is not proven.
- Keeps the kernel stable and available for opt-in use and targeted experiments.
- Forces future “defaults ON” decisions to be backed by measurable outcomes.

### Negative
- Without explicit opt-in, enforcement protections will not apply by default.
- Requires disciplined enablement in workflows where safety invariants are desired.

### Neutral
- This decision does not change the kernel’s correctness claims; it changes only default activation.

## Re-evaluation Criteria (Defaults ON)
Defaults ON requires all of:
1. Cached Orient (Phase 0.1.4.6) implemented (memoized decisions / reduced agent burden).
2. Re-benchmark shows **measured improvement** in Resolved@1 (ΔResolved@1 > 0) with confidence.
3. No unacceptable increase in cycle time / friction.

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Defaults ON immediately
- Pros: Maximum safety-by-default.
- Cons: Pays friction without demonstrated effectiveness lift; risks being “ceremony without value”.
- Why rejected: Phase 0.1.4 lift is not proven.

### Alternative 2: Defaults ON for a narrow subset
- Pros: Safety-by-default for high-risk work.
- Cons: Requires stable risk taxonomy + deterministic enablement surface.
- Why deferred: Needs clearer opt-in/selection mechanism and consistent measurement.
