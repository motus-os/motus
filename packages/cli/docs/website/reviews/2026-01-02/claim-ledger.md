# Claim Ledger Audit (2026-01-02)

## Proof Ledger Claims (published)

| ID | Claim | Evidence | Where Used |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| six_call_api | Coordination surface is six API calls. | Coordination API docs | Evidence registry + core docs. |
| module_registry | Current/building/future is defined in the module registry. | Module registry | Evidence registry + implementation docs. |
| kernel_schema | Kernel schema v0.1.3 defines the authoritative tables. | Kernel schema docs | Evidence registry + schema docs. |
| docs_registry_sync | Docs and website registry are kept in sync. | Registry sync gate | Evidence registry + docs hub. |

## Out-of-Ledger Claims (documented)

| Claim | Evidence | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Legacy external survey claim | Removed | Dropped from hero due to insufficient evidence alignment. |
| Six-call workflow (module summary) | Coordination API docs | Supported by proof ledger; link as needed in docs. |
| OODA phases / zero cloud required | Architecture facts | Appears on How It Works; add to ledger if you want strict adjacency. |

## Recommendation
Keep proof panels as the primary claim surface. Add any remaining numeric claims to the proof ledger or remove them.
