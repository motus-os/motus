# CTA Map (2026-01-02)

## Primary CTA by Page

| Page | Primary CTA | Destination | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home (`/`) | See How It Works | `/how-it-works` | Install command is a static copy block (not a link). |
| How It Works | View the schema docs | `/schema` | Secondary: “Explore strategy library.” |
| Ecosystem | Detail panel links | Varies per node | No single page-level CTA; links are node-specific. |
| Implementation | Persona paths | `#kernel`, `#proof-engine`, `#module-manager`, docs | Hub page with role-based CTAs; no single CTA. |
| Strategies | Learn about the open source model | `/open-source` | CTA at end of page. |
| Schema | View KERNEL-SCHEMA.md | GitHub | Direct external link. |
| Open Source | View on GitHub | GitHub | Contribute CTA. |
| Privacy | Open an issue | GitHub issues | Contact CTA. |
| Terms | Open an issue | GitHub issues | Contact CTA. |

## Gaps / Notes
- Ecosystem and Implementation are intentionally hub-style; consider adding a single “Next step” CTA if you want a more linear journey.
