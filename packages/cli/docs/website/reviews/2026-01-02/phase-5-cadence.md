# Phase 5 - Visual Cadence Review (2026-01-02)

## Goal
Ensure the narrative rhythm feels deliberate: quiet context -> proof -> CTA.

## Page Cadence Notes

### Home
- Hero (problem framing + CTA)
- Proof panels (evidence-backed claims)
- Persona journey grid
- Module grid
- Open source trust block
- Install CTA

Status: PASS. Rhythm reads as: statement -> proof -> paths -> capabilities -> trust -> action.

### How It Works
- Hero + metrics
- Work Compiler block
- Coordination API
- Kernel schema CTA
- Real code examples
- Final CTA

Status: PASS. Technical depth increases gradually, CTA placed after proof sections.

### Ecosystem
- Hero
- Flowchart (system-level overview)
- Interactive map + detail
- Group deep dives

Status: PASS. Flowchart now anchors the mental model before interaction.

### Implementation
- Header + status semantics
- Persona paths
- Kernel invariants
- Bundled modules
- Docs reference

Status: PASS. Reads as path selection -> invariants -> modules -> references.

### Schema / Strategies / Source Available
- Single narrative blocks with CTA

Status: PASS. No abrupt tone shifts.

## Recommendation
If we want an even tighter cadence on Home, we can reduce the vertical gap between proof panels and persona grid (`pad="tight"` on the persona section). Otherwise, the current rhythm is consistent.
