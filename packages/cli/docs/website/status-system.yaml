# ============================================
# DOMAIN CONSTRAINTS (what statuses each domain allows)
# ============================================

constraints:
  modules:
    allowed: [current, building, future]
    reason: "Modules have full lifecycle"

  patterns:
    allowed: [current, building, future]
    reason: "Patterns have full lifecycle"

  strategies:
    allowed: [current, building, future]
    reason: "Strategies have full lifecycle"

  claims:
    allowed: [current, future]
    reason: "Claims are proven (current) or not yet proven (future). No 'building' - claims are binary."

    allowed: [current, building, future]
    reason: "Ecosystem nodes have full lifecycle. Use separate 'origin' field for internal/external."

  chapters:
    allowed: [current, building, future]
    reason: "Chapters follow module lifecycle and must stay aligned with module registry."

# ============================================
# ORIGIN (separate from status)
# ============================================
