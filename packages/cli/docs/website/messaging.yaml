hero:
  # The hook - creates tension

  action_line: "Claim work. Attach proof. Ship a receipt."
  cta_text: "Get your first receipt"
  cta_url: "/get-started/"
  # No claim_status/proof_id - this is positioning, not a provable claim

pain_statement:
  # Pain without problematic statistics
  short: "AI agents act without accountability."
  full: "AI agents complete tasks with no record of what happened, why, or whether it worked."
  # This is observable truth, not a cited claim
