# CORE MESSAGING
# ============================================

one_liner: "What did your agent actually do? Motus knows."

tagline: "Every action logged. Every decision recorded. Every outcome a receipt."

hero:
  # The hook - asks the question nobody says out loud
  headline: "What did your agent actually do?"
  subheadline: "Motus knows."
  # The position
  value_prop: "Every action logged. Every decision recorded. Every outcome a receipt."
  # The action
  action_line: "Claim. Prove. Release. Get a receipt."
  cta_text: "Get your first receipt"
  cta_url: "/get-started/"
  # No claim_status/proof_id - this is positioning, not a provable claim

pain_statement:
  # Pain without problematic statistics
  short: "AI agents act without a durable record."
  full: "AI agents complete tasks with no durable record of what happened, why, or whether it worked."
  # This is observable truth, not a cited claim

solution_statement:
  short: "Motus keeps the receipts."
  full: "Motus provides a single API loop for agent coordination. Claim work, attach evidence, ship receipts."
